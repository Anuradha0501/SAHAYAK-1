# SAHAYAK
Security and crime related issues have become rampant in most urban areas across the world. In todayâ€™s era where there is everything available online. So when it comes to public and police assistance we lack technology. We don't have any website or application which can connect people to police or law enforcement officers. 

So we had proposed a project named **SAHAYAK**. Sahayak is a web app which is a responsive web application for Police and Public assistance. This web app provides online assistance for the public to report any crime in minutes.
